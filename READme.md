# Network Utilization Monitor using SDN (POX + Mininet)

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

To monitor network bandwidth utilization using Software Defined Networking (SDN) by collecting flow statistics from switches and calculating real-time bandwidth usage.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

* Mininet
* POX Controller
* OpenFlow Protocol
* Ubuntu (Linux VM)

---

## 🧠 Approach

* Created a virtual network topology using Mininet
* Used POX controller to interact with OpenFlow switches
* Collected flow statistics (byte counters) from switches
* Calculated bandwidth using byte differences over time
* Displayed real-time network utilization

---

## ⚙️ Controller Logic

The controller periodically requests flow statistics from the switch.

Bandwidth is calculated using:

Bandwidth = (Current Byte Count − Previous Byte Count) / Time Interval

* Each flow is identified using source and destination IP
* The controller computes bandwidth for each flow
* Results are printed in real-time

---

## ▶️ Steps to Run

### 1. Start POX Controller

```
cd ~/pox
./pox.py forwarding.l2_learning misc.monitor
```

---

### 2. Start Mininet

(Open a new terminal)

```
sudo mn --controller=remote --topo single,3
```

---

### 3. Test Connectivity

```
pingall
```

Expected:

* 0% packet loss

---

### 4. Generate Traffic

```
h1 ping h2
```

OR

```
iperf
```

---

## 📊 Output

* Displays bandwidth for each flow in Bytes/sec
* Example output:

```
Flow 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 | Bandwidth: 114.96 Bytes/s
```

* Bandwidth updates periodically based on traffic

---

## 🔁 Test Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Normal Traffic

* Traffic is generated between hosts using ping/iperf
* Controller displays continuous bandwidth usage

---

### ❌ Scenario 2: Reduced/No Traffic

* When traffic is stopped, bandwidth values decrease
* Demonstrates real-time monitoring capability

## 📈 Future Scope

* Visualize bandwidth using graphs
* Implement traffic filtering or firewall rules
* Extend to larger and complex network topologies
* Integrate with real-time dashboards

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SDN enables centralized control and monitoring of networks.
The POX controller dynamically collects flow statistics and calculates bandwidth utilization in real-time, allowing efficient observation and analysis of network behavior.
